If you're considering a big investment, then maybe you should talk to those closest to you for advice. Don't do anything you'll regret for the rest of your life.

You got up today knowing you had to do something meaningful. You can do it by just looking at the bigger picture and accepting that this is who you are now. Today is only one day in your life, but that doesn't mean it isn't the most important.

If you think you might be ready for a major commitment, then the real question is, what is holding you back. Hesitate if you must, but know that you can't win every battle, but you can always do your best.

It's time to turn over a new leaf. And this works by being open and honest with yourself, and being grateful for what you've got. There's no reason to think you're anything less than amazing.
