It's time to turn over a new leaf. You can do it by just eating less of what you want and more of what you need, and knowing that you've made the right decision. There's every reason to hesitate, but if your heart says to take action, maybe you should listen.

Are you considering rekindling an old flame? Ambiguity aside, this will become the time you decided and everything will be clear to you.

Before you can find answers for yourself, maybe you should look beyond yourself to do some good in the community. Plus the good in the world will become more obvious.

If you're not sure what direction your life is headed in, it might be time to take that plunge. Come to peace with the fact that you can't win every battle, but you can always do your best. If you set your heart on it, there's nothing you can't achieve.
