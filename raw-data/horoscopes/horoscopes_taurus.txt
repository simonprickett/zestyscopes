If you feel your life needs more meaning, then you should listen to a new radio station. Plus the pieces will start to fall in place. It's a good time to shop for essentials or emergency supplies, and take care of anything that you've been putting off.

Are you going to be talking to your significant other? The next week will be the day you became YOU and you did the right thing. You feel emotionally centered and ready for almost anything.

Your Mercury is rising, which means that you should watch for individuals of your own sign Taurus which is a sign that will be compatible with you, over the coming weeks. Don't be afraid to look out for you today.
