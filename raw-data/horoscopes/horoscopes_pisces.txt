If you have doubts, it might be time to focus more on yourself than others. Understand that sometimes things don't go your way.

If you're looking for direction, then join the club. But it's never too late to reconsider your options.

If you're considering a big investment, then consider taking the advice of someone who knows you, but that you're not all that close with. There's no reason to rush into anything rash.

If you can, take some time to meditate on the answers. And then your purpose will become self-evident.
